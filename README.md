1- I have designed this test app from scratch without using any CSS framework.
2- App is responsive as asked in test.
3- SpaceX mission list fetched using API
4- Filters are working but there is some issue with API you can check in console URL is being fetched correctly but data is not showing as it should show.
5- I have test the app in google lighthouse and all the result is 100% same I have attached in file.
